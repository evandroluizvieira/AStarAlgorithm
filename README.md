## Overview
The A* algorithm, also known as 'A Star Algorithm', is a widely used method for pathfinding in graphs or grids. It works by exploring nodes in a graph based on their cost and heuristic value to find the optimal path from a start node to a goal node. The algorithm iteratively evaluates nodes by considering both the cost of reaching that node from the start and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal from that node. This estimate is provided by a heuristic function. A* selects nodes with the lowest total cost (the sum of the cost from the start and the heuristic estimate to the goal) for further exploration. This process continues until the goal node is reached or no more nodes are available for expansion. A* guarantees finding the optimal path if certain conditions are met, including admissibility of the heuristic function.
